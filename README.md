# DL4JDSLStudien3

This repository contains the result of a student project, aiming at implementing a DSL (named PrePro) for preprocessing of time series data with the Truffle Lanugage Implementation Framework.
In addition it contains a NetBeans module to support the usage of PrePro with file type recognition and syntax highlighting. 

For more information about the PrePro Implementation see [here](https://github.com/MobMonRob/DL4JDSLStudien2/tree/master/preprolanguage).
